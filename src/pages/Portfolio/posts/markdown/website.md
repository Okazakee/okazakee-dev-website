# Calypso-Pi Project
[okazakee.dev](okazakee.dev)

The project is based on creating a personal **Web Platform** to display myself, my projects and my
passion in internet. It has 3 main pages which are: **Biography**, **Portfolio** and **Blog**, and an Admin panel
to manage and edit posts.
The website will be built using **NextJS** as the frontend framework, fetching data such as images links
and posts markdowns that will be stored in **MongoDB Atlas**.

*The project is completely open-source all details on the dedicated [GitHub page](https://github.com/Okazakee/okazakee-dev-website).*
